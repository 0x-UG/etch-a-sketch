# Etch-A-Sketch

In this project, I'll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I'm going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch using HTML, CSS and JS.

## What this project is about

This project is a mini sketch book that starts out as an empty grid box but changes color whenever the mouse hovers over the grid similar to how a pen would leave a trail on a paper.
The user should be able to change the number of squares on each side of the grid. Once selected, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same space as before so that you have a new sketch pad.
